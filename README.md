# Lego Roshar Map

This is a fully Lego mosaic of Roshar, the world in which Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive book series takes place. The original map was designed by [Isaac Stewart](https://www.isaacstewart.com/maps-design-1) who does most of the maps for Brandon Sanderson. The landmass was modeled after a mathematical concept called a [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal), specifically a [Julia Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Set).



The final version is shown below followed by the full digital version.

The full art piece stretches 26"(65cm) tall by 41"(104cm) with a total element count of 10,240 parts just in the mosaic alone and over 11,000 with the frame.

## You can make this yourself!

This was designed around the official Lego set [#31203 Lego Art World Map](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/world-map-31203). It can be fully recreated using the provided instructions using only the elements included in that set.

The instructions are broken up into **40 16x16 tiles**. Each `.png` image in the `\Instructions` folder is names using that specific row and column number. For example, the first tile's image is named `1-1.png` and the second tile in and three down is `3-2.png`. Each set of 8 tiles per row is in a separate folder. This means that the first tile's image is located at `LegoRosharMap\Instructions\Row1\1-1.png`. The correct location of each tile can be referenced at any time using the `Legend.png` image shown below. ![Legend](Intructions/Legend.png)
